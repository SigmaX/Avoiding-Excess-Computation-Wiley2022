# Gremlin asynchronous and synchronous data

This contains `gremlin_async_and_sync.zip` that is a compressed CSV file,
`gremlin_async_and_sync.csv`.

I used git LFS to store the zip file because storing big ole binary files in 
repos isn't cool.  You should be able to get the full zip file via `git lfs 
fetch --all `.  

## If you need to install git lfs

[This](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs#installing-git-lfs) 
should get you started.

## Jupyter Notebooks

* `gremlin_data_wrangling.ipynb` -- for merging async and sync data into a 
  single CSV
* `gremlin analytics.ipynb` -- analytics and visualizations of gremlin runs
